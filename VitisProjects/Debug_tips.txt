HDMI OUTPUT DEBUGGING CHECKLIST (Pynq-Z1, VDMA + HDMI Out)

1. Incorrect Pixel Clock Frequency
   - Problem: HDMI requires a precise clock (e.g. 74.25 MHz for 720p).
   - Fix: Use a Clocking Wizard to generate the exact required frequency.

2. Video Timing Mismatch
   - Problem: VTC not matching 720p spec.
   - Fix: Use proper VTC settings for 1280x720@60Hz.

3. VDMA Misconfiguration
   - Problem: Incorrect DMA settings (wrong stride, H size, etc.).
   - Fix:
     - Enable Circular Buffer
     - Set correct HoriSize = WIDTH * BYTES_PER_PIXEL
     - Set Stride = WIDTH * BYTES_PER_PIXEL

4. Unflushed Cache or Uninitialized Buffers
   - Problem: CPU cache holds dirty frame buffer data.
   - Fix: Call Xil_DCacheFlushRange() after writing to each frame.

5. Incorrect Data Format
   - Problem: Pixel order incorrect (e.g. BGR vs RGB).
   - Fix: Pack pixels correctly (usually B, G, R).

6. HDMI PHY Not Enabled
   - Problem: TMDS or clock signals not active.
   - Fix: Ensure RGB2DVI IP is correctly configured and connected.

7. Incorrect Frame Buffer Address
   - Problem: Memory location invalid or unmapped.
   - Fix: Use address like 0x10000000, ensure mapped to DDR in block design.

8. Monitor Compatibility Issues
   - Problem: Some monitors don’t like certain HDMI modes.
   - Fix: Test with known-good monitor or resolution (e.g., 800x600@60Hz).

9. Missing Reset or Enable Signals
   - Problem: Some IP blocks may be stuck in reset or idle.
   - Fix: Use GPIO or constant blocks to drive enable/reset inputs as needed.

10. Clock Domain Mismatches
    - Problem: HDMI output and VDMA on different unsynchronized clocks.
    - Fix: Sync video timing, AXIS to Video Out, and VTC with same video clock.

Notes:
- Always check your HDMI cable and connector.
- Monitor should show signal detection even with a blank (black) frame.
- If HDMI isn’t detected at all, start debugging from RGB2DVI backward.
